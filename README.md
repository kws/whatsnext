# What's Next?

Do you ever look at the calendar, or get a reminder from Outlook that you have a meeting
starting in 10 minutes? Just enough time to answer a couple of emails... and then suddenly you
are 10 minutes late instead?

What's Next is a simple [React App](https://reactjs.org/) using the 
[Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js#readme).

Using the awesome GitHub Pages Deploy Action the library builds automatically and deploys to
GitHub Pages on [k-si.com/whatsnext](https://www.k-si.com/whatsnext/). 

## Build

This app was created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), so has the 
[usual scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts).

## Ideas or suggestions? 

I love hearing your ideas, so please share, or even better, fork away and send me a PR!
